/**
 * Prisma Client Setup
 * 
 * This file will contain the Prisma client configuration for the LINE Web3 Game Center.
 * 
 * NOTE: The actual Prisma client currently lives at /lib/db.ts.
 * In a later refactoring step, it will be moved here.
 * 
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Configure Prisma client with proper connection settings
 * - Handle connection pooling via @prisma/adapter-pg
 * - Provide transaction helpers for complex operations
 * - Export a singleton Prisma client instance
